        I'm a 26 year old software developer from Skipton, England. I specialise
        in front end web development but have a full stack background and dabble
        in full stack in my spare time using a GraphQL/Nexus/Prisma stack.

        I built my first website when I was 10 years old by finding a template
        online, purchasing a domain with hosting and uploading files I edited in
        Adobe Dreamweaver via CPanel. It had all the cool things like scrolling
        text and music playing in the background.

        Roll on 16 years and I've competed at Great Britain level for Canoe
        Slalom at a junior level, played the Walter White character by working
        in chemistry for 3 years, supported schools by being a first, second and
        third line support engineer, and eventually self taught myself Ruby on
        Rails to land a University level position as a Software Developer.

        From starting out in the front end development industry by building
        dashboard level features for a back end Ruby on Rails application, I
        progressed to architecturing a Vue front end with a headless WordPress
        back end stack on to architecturing an award winning React/TypeScript
        stack which implemented component driven development complimented by
        Storybook.

        I'm now working as a front end tech lead for a company called 9xb based
        in Leeds. I help drive the front end team forward ensuring we're using
        the most powerful tools available to build and maintain next generation
        websites.
